Using an Arduino Pro Micro (ATMega328u4)
  read an MPU6050 accelerometer
  control an X9C103S 10kOhm digital potentiometer
  
This acts as an expression pedal for controlling guitar signals with pedals or devices that accept an expression pedal input.
In my case I am controlling an Electro Harmonix (EHX) Worm.
