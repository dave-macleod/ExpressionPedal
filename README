Name
  ExpressionPedal
Purpose
  Using Arduino ATMega32u4 5v, aka Pro Micro,
   read an MPU6050 accelerometer
   control an X9C103S 10kOhm digital potentiometer
  
  This acts as an expression pedal for controlling guitar signals with pedals or devices that accept an expression pedal input.
  In my case I am controlling an Electro Harmonix (EHX) Worm.

Physical connections  

  MPU6050 connections
    GND to GND
    VCC to VCC
    SDA to pin 2
    SCL to pin 3
    
  X9C103S connections
    GND to GND
    VCC to VCC
    INC to pin 5
    U/D to pin 6
    CS to pin 7
